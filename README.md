# PLCBot
Pennsylvania Liquor Control Bot is a Python program designed to gather pricing information from the PLCB search site. This is a program that I have wanted to build for a log time and now finally have the chance. I will be using the TDD style of development which is something that I have not done before. Follow along in the journal.md document.

Run SaveBot.py then SearchBot.py
