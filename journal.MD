#TDD Journal

## Pretest
* unittest will be used for all testing


## 4/10/15:6:20
* Created Git repo and wrote read me
* Started this journal 
* Need to divide everything into function/method
* Things should have inputs and outputs so that they are testable


## 4/10/15:6:30
* First part will get the Data from the site
* Will spirt this part into 3 branches Data Retrieval, Data Processing, Data storage 
* Split it up so it is easy to test.



## 4/10/15:6:50
* This first branch will be for Data Retrieval 
* going to work on on using BS4 to get the data
* The goal is to have a function that handles retrieving the webpage and gets something to process 
* Wrote Failing Test


## 4/10/15:8:00
* Made the test pass and closed the branch
* Will now work on the Data Processing branch

## 4/10/15:9:00
* Made the test work
* So far this just feels like an odd way of writing code I am not sure what it helps
* Because of all the planing I feel like I am behind on the project 

## 4/10/15:9:22
* Made the test pass
* Feels like I have done nothing important
* It is like I am writing a bunch of helper functions instead of real code

## 4/10/15:10:22
* Parse Item was a good idea because it made me think about what I wanted
* TDD feels the the woodworking of software, think and plan before you do
* Going to move onto Data Storage and then stop for the night


## 4/10/15:11:05
* File I/O does not make sense in a functions since it is so simple in python
* What does make sense is something that turns a list into a CSV string 
* Made Test that fails
